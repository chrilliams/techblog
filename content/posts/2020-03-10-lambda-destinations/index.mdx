excerpt: Using destinations as a deadletter queue for Lambda

So after an hour of trying to get destinations working for Lambda functions being triggered from SQS, it seems its not supported and I should have
looked more clearfully at the blog posted by AWS [Introducing AWS Lambda Destinations](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/introducing-aws-lambda-destinations/).

There doesn't seem to be a clear reason for this, so I am completely guessing that because destinations only support asynchronous invocation and SQS
polls for new messages??  Behind the scenes AWS has a Lambda function polling SQS which then triggers your lambda function, which is why it seems event based.
