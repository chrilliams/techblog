excerpt: Fully automating Certificate Validatation for ACM
---

Have a CloudFormation stack create everything you need is a great thing.  It means other can start working
on your product quickly and I find is also easier for me to maintain.

Before the Amazon certificate authority (CA) can issue a certificate for your site, AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) must verify
that you own or control all of the domain names that you specified in your request.  This isn't supported by cloudformation alone,
so we will have to use a Lambda to create the DNS record for validation.

**Option 1: Custom Resource**

This is my 'goto' method when CloudFormation is missing that little bit of functionality.
Similar to this post https://www.callumpember.com/Validate-an-ACM-cert-with-CloudFormation/
A custom resource LambdaFunction polls the CloudFormation stack waiting for the ACM Certificate
resource to output an event with the DNS validation record details.
This information is then used to create the required DNS record for validation.


**Option 2: Cloud Trail. Doesn't work**

Another option is to trigger creating the certificate verification process from CloudTrail, but unfortunately there isn't a
way to get the content for the dns record

```yaml
    events:
      # http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/events/EventTypes.html#console_event_type
      - cloudwatchEvent:
          event:
            source:
            - aws.acm
            detail-type:
            - AWS API Call via CloudTrail
            detail:
              eventSource:
              - acm.amazonaws.com
              eventName:
              - RequestCertificate
```
