excerpt: Using Webpack with the serverless framework
---

Webpack is a module bundler. Its main purpose is to bundle JavaScript files for usage in a browser, yet it is
also capable of transforming, bundling, or packaging just about any resource or asset.

It also turns out its great when used with serverless and the Serverless framework for many reasons

### What setup is required?

Install the serverless-webpack and the webpack npm modules as dev dependencies:

```js
npm i -D serverless-webpack webpack
```

Add the plugin to the ```serverless.yaml```

```js
plugins:
  - serverless-webpack
```

Lastly, add a ```webpack.config.js``` in the root of your serverless project

```js
const slsw = require('serverless-webpack');
const webpack = require('webpack');

module.exports = {
    entry: slsw.lib.entries,
    mode: slsw.lib.webpack.isLocal ? "development" : "production",
};
```

**entry: slsw.lib.entries** - plugin determines the correct handler entry points at build time
**mode: slsw.lib.webpack.isLocal ? "development" : "production"** - lib.webpack.isLocal is a boolean
property that is set to true, if any known mechanism is used in the current Serverless invocation that runs code
locally.
This allows to set properties in the webpack configuration differently depending if the lambda code is run on the local machine or deployed.

Huge benefits for very little effort.
