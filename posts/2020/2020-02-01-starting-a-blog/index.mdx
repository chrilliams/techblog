## The start of it all

I spend a lot of time 'playing' with tech and try to learn as much a possible. The idea of the blog is to help me
remember usual tech bits that I have learnt. After a few busy days in work its very difficult to recall
the fun stuff I was looking at. I also hope that anyone reading this will also find it useful.

### so that led me to looking at blog sites

Wanting to learn while maintaining a blog site was important. I also wanted to focus on the same dev stack that I
had been using in work; so a blog site using npm, node, react was something I was looking for. I came across
[gatsbyjs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and decided to play.

There were many tutorials for creating a blogging site, but it was always based on a couple of commands from someone
else's theme without really understand how I could evolve it myself. Until I came across
[Scott Spence](https://scottspence.me/) post on
[freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/build-a-developer-blog-from-scratch-with-gatsby-and-mdx/). It started
from nothing that with lots of explanation. Thanks Scott.

I might change to a ready made template, but I feel that spending time really understanding whats running a blog site would
be beneficial.

Features
code snippets with a copy functionality:

```jsx

      padding: 10,
      background: "white"
    }}
  >
    {Object.entries(props).map(([key, val]) => (
      <pre key={key}>
        <strong style={{ color: "white", background: "red" }}>{key} ðŸ’©</strong>
        {JSON.stringify(val, "", " ")}
      </pre>
