title: Using linters against staged git files

After annoying myself many many times what a build fails on a CI server went there are simple linting failures, I decided to do a bit of research to see if it could be automated for staged files before commit.

I've been using `prettier` in Visual Code Studio for some time and liked it, but it does rely on every developer within the project setting things up.

## pre-commit checks

Pre-commit checks run after staging your changes and running git commit and before a commit is completed. If the checks fail then the commit is not made and an error shown, while if all checks pass the commit is made as normal.

## lint-stage

Then I found [lint-stage](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged), which seem to be exactly what I wanted.

### Setup

running:
`npx mrm lint-staged`

is the quickest way to get it running. This will install husky and lint-staged, then add a configuration to the project’s package.json that will automatically format supported files in a pre-commit hook.

This will automatically to you package.json for you.

```json
  "husky": {
    "hooks": {
      "pre-commit": "lint-staged"
    }
  },
  "lint-staged": {
    "*.{js,css,md}": "prettier --write"
  }
```

> you need to have prettier installed `npm install --save-dev prettier` before running the above commands. It will then set up your package.json for you :)

### commit code

When commiting code the hook with automatically run and fix any linting errors

```sh
xxx@xxx techblog % git commit -m "staged-lint"
husky > pre-commit (node v12.13.1)
