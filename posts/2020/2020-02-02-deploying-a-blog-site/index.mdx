There are many way to host a static page live, and I have tried a number in the past.  There are great services
like Netlify, a S3 bucket, or AWS Amplify.  I wanted something that cause be quickly deployed from a github repo and 
ghpages had be mentioned for blog sites, plus its completely free.

### Github Pages
GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service that takes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files straight from a repository on GitHub,
optionally runs the files through a build process, and publishes a website.

You can host your site on GitHub's github.io domain or your own custom domain.

> if you haven't already, create a github project and push your code

#### Configuring the GitHub Pages source branch
You must select which branch will be deployed from your repository settings in GitHub for GitHub Pages to function. On GitHub:

1. Navigate to your site’s repository.
1. Under the repository name, click Settings.
1. In the GitHub Pages section, use the Source drop-down to select master (for publishing to the root subdomain) or gh-pages (for publishing to a path like /docs) as your GitHub Pages publishing source.
1. Click Save.

#### Installing the gh-pages package
The easiest way to push a Gatsby app to GitHub Pages is by using a package called gh-pages.

``` shell
npm install gh-pages --save-dev
```
Then add a deploy script to package.json in your repository’s codebase:

``` json
{
  "scripts": {
    "deploy": "gatsby build --prefix-paths && gh-pages -d public"
  }
}
```

Assuming that github was expecting the generated 'public' folder in source control. I was wrong.

Running 
``` shell
  npm run deploy
```
created another branch called 'gh-pages' and updated the Github Pages source branch in the settings mentioned above.

It great that we don't have to worry about how the deployment works, and the site is running at https://chrilliams.github.io/techblog/

If this doesn't work, deployment information is available via environments in the github repo.
